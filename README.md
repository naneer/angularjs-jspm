# angularjs-jspm-typescript

I added a layer for typescript to prepare for the next version which will be compatible with es6 later, so I'm currently transpiling into AMD modules.  I added karma to run unit tests, opting in to write straight js AMD modules since jasmine tests are simple to write as it is.  This is on hold, was just for exploratory purposes to learn about these options.
