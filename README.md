# angularjs-jspm-typescript

My repository for storing an angularjs jspm build, heavily influenced, if not borrowed, from GoCardless es6-angularjs - just putting something very simple together to follow their angular styleguide while using jspm.  Just a project to learn ecmascript 6 and prepare for Angular 2.0.  And in a sudden turn of events, added a layer for typescript learning to prepare for the next version which will be compatible with es6.
