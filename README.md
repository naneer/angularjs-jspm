# angularjs-jspm-typescript

My repository for storing an angularjs jspm build, the base setup is influenced from GoCardless es6-angularjs. Started as a repo to learn ecmascript 6 modules and prepare for Angular 2.0.  Hopefully, I'll be able to focus back on as soon as all the parts are inline and available. 

Recently, I added a layer for typescript to prepare for the next version which will be compatible with es6 later, so I'm currently transpiling into AMD modules.  I added karma to run unit tests, opting in to write straight js AMD modules since jasmine tests are simple to write as it is.
