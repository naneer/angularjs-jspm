# angularjs-jspm-typescript

My repository for storing an angularjs jspm build, heavily influenced, if not borrowed, from GoCardless es6-angularjs - just putting something very simple together to learn ecmascript 6 modules and prepare for Angular 2.0.  \n 
Recently, added a layer for typescript to prepare for the next version which will be compatible with es6.
